# Hello, world!

October 7, 2025

Welcome to my blog! I'm Mike, an IT Support Engineer by day and a an avid home labber by night. I'm endlessly fascinated by computer technology, and this is the place where I write about it.

I grew up in the era of dial-up modems, AOL Online, MSN Messenger and MySpace. I remember coming home from school and sitting down in front of our Windows 98 SE desktop computer that had a monitor that weighed about as much as I did, clicking to connect to the Internet, and savoring that weird, wonderfully futuristic (or so I thought) sound as the modem dialed out to the ISP. I was filled with wonder by the world that opened up to me: friends, music, games, my favourite band's website, my crush's MySpace page, all at my fingertips. It truly felt magical.

Connectivity between computing systems, and ultimately between people, is simply amazing. The sense of being part of something huge, that connects us all together and allows us to share, communicate, learn and play together in real time is a gift that people in previous historical eras couldn't imagine. Networks are as old a human society itself; but the massive digital information super highways that constitute the Internet of today are unprecedented. The Internet is woven into almost everything we do every day, so it's understandable that most of us have come to take it for granted. But familiarity should not dampen our awe and sense of wonder. We should ask ourselves - how does this all actually work?

As a professional, I seek to understand the design and operation of networks - how the protocols, software and hardware systems that enable connectivity work and how to build networks that meet human and business requirements. To that end you will find here a lot of exploratory articles and how-tos that dissect the function and configuration of network and server environments. But as a prolific user of the Internet I am also interested in online privacy, consumer rights and personal digital autonomy. You will also find articles that discuss self-hosting, digital literacy and online safety.

I hope you find something useful on this site. But most of all, I hope that the content here inspires a sense of wonder in you, even if small, and spurs you to wonder how things work. Cheers!
