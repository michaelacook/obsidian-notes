| **IOS XE 2.x/3.x (≈2008–2016)**                              | IOS-XE        | ASR/Catalyst edge                            | Linux kernel + IOSd; ISSU/SMU; NETCONF/RESTCONF (early), better scale    | Platform-specific feature gaps                 | Introduced on ASR1000                 | Useful background           |
| **IOS XE 16.x (Denali/Everest/Fuji/Gibraltar) (≈2016–2019)** | IOS-XE        | Enterprise routing/switching                 | Unified release naming; DNA/SD-Access groundwork; model-driven telemetry | Naming complexity across platforms             | Long-lived 16.x LTS lines             | Modern enterprise prep      |
| **IOS XE 17.x (≈2019–present)**                              | IOS-XE        | Enterprise routing/switching/SD-WAN          | Single “17.x” stream; SD-WAN, SDA, gNMI/NETCONF/YANG, app-hosting        | Feature timing varies by hardware              | Current mainstream XE                 | Highly relevant             |
| **NX-OS 4.x–10.x (≈2008–present)**                           | NX-OS         | Data center switching                        | Modular L2/L3; VXLAN/EVPN (later); fabric features                       | DC-focused; differs from IOS CLI               | Nexus platforms                       | DC track / optional         |
