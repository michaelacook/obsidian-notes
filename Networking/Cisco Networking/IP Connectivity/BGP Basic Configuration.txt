1. Enter BGP config mode

router bgp [AS number]

2. Configure neighbors

-must manually specify each neighbor

neighbor [ip address] remote-as [neighbor AS number]

3. Advertise networks

-no wildcard masks, full netmask
-have to enter exact network and mask of network to advertise, unlike IGPs

network [ip] [mask]

-there must be a matching route in the route table to advertise it in BGP; this makes advertising summary routes tricky
-to advertise a summary route that doesn't actually appear in the route table, create a static route using the Null0 interface as the exit interface
-often called a discard route

ip route [summary-ip] [mask] null0

---------------------------
1. neighbor AS incorrectly config'd
2. summary network incorrectly advertised
3. advertising routes into area 1 instead of area 0
