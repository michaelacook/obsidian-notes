- Network baseline: baseline behaviour of the network under normal conditions
	- used for monitoring to measure against
	- a network baseline should answer the following questions:
		- How does the network perform during a normal or average day? 
		- Where are the most errors occurring? 
		- What part of the network is most heavily used? 
		- What part of the network is least used? 
		- Which devices should be monitored and what alert thresholds should be set? 
		- Can the network meet the identified policies?
	- The initial network performance baseline sets the stage for measuring the effects of network changes and subsequent troubleshooting efforts. Therefore, it is important to plan for it carefully.
