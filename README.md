# Obsidian Notes Collection

Welcome! This is a collection of various sets of notes I've written over the years on the many and various technologies I've dipped my toes into. Despite being an avid note taker, I have never created a single source of truth for my knowledge. This project is an attempt to take my hodge podge of notes, how-tos, home lab write-ups and ramblings and develop them into a single digital garden. This collection will also form the basis of my personal blog in the near future.

These notes have two main purposes: 1) to document what I learn so that I don't have to re-learn it again six months; and 2) to document the extensive home lab tinkering I do. As a bear of very little brain, I find myself constantly struggling to remember the things I do and the things I read up on.

This project is published under the permissive MIT license. If you find something of value here, please use it and distribute freely. Knowledge is a collective good and should be shared openly.
