#### Key Takeaways
- Planning
	- CIDR block ranges should be planned well and shouldn't overlap
- Vnets and subnets should be planned in a way that eases management
	- group subnets so that VMs with similar security and access requirements are placed in subnets together
- Security - use defense-in-depth
	- secure at the perimeter with Azure DDOS Protection and Azure Firewall
	- secure internally with NSGs and ASGs
	- secure traffic to PaaS services - only those who need it
		- private and service endpoints
- Connectivity
	- users and resources should be connected to Azure securely
		- VPNs, ExpressRoute
		- protect and secure public IPs
			- limit their use
			- connect to VMs via private IPs and not public IPs
- Availability
	- some services are regional and some are global
	- combine regional and global services for maximum availability
- Troubleshooting
	- Use portal and Network Watcher
