The [Proxmox documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html) is a bit terse. This collection is a series of quick-start how tos to get up and running with different features and configurations quickly. Currently there is no particular order to this collection. Once the collection grows and themes emerge, it will be organized topically.

- [[Physical disk pass-through]]
- [[Add Additional Storage]]
- [[Creating Users, Groups and Assigning Permissions]]
- [[Creating a temp directory for snapshots]]
