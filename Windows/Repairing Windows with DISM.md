## Using DISM to Repair Windows
- Can be used when System File Checker is unable to repair corruption
- Use in an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell session
- `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth`
	- `/CheckHealth` quick check for errors
	- All other switches stay the same with most usage cases
- `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth`
	- Detailed scan for errors, may take longer
- `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`
	- Similar to SFC but more powerful
	- Restore files from a backup and/or Windows Update
	- If this doesn't work, you may need to download a new Windows image. I.e., if the Windows refresh image or backup itself is corrupted

		- Make sure you get the correct Windows version that matches the one you have
			- You can only download the most recent version directly from Microsoft
			- Use Windows Media Creation Tool
			- Or download from 365 admin portal
		- Mount the image, assign a drive letter
			- `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:wim:D:\Source\install.wim`
			- This will repair Windows system files using a fresh Windows image
			- Append `/LimitAccess` switch to command to prevent Windows Update from interfering
