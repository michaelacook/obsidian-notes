### **Best Practices for Troubleshooting Windows Problems**

- **Consider Recent Changes**
    - If a machine was working fine but suddenly has issues, the problem is often related to a recent change.
    - Possible changes include:
        - Configuration setting modifications
        - New software installation
        - Software or system uninstallation
    - Undoing the most recent change may resolve the issue.

- **Document Everything**
    - Keep a written record of all troubleshooting steps.
    - Helps retrace steps if troubleshooting goes in the wrong direction.
    - Easier to undo changes when thereâ€™s a documented list.
    - **Tip**: Create a backup before starting troubleshooting to easily revert changes if necessary.

- **Make One Change at a Time**
    - Avoid making multiple changes at once in hopes of solving the issue.
    - Instead:
        - Make a single change.
        - Test the change.
        - If unsuccessful, undo it before making another change.
    - This method helps track what actually fixes the problem.

- **Be Cautious with Internet Fixes**
    - The internet has many solutions, but not all are reliable or relevant.
    - Some solutions may be misleading or inappropriate for the specific problem.
    - Verify the credibility of sources before applying any fix.

- **Consider Multiple Problems**
    - Sometimes, a machine may have more than one issue at the same time.
    - If a fix is applied but problems persist, consider the possibility of additional underlying issues.
    - Continue troubleshooting systematically if the initial solution does not fully resolve the issue.
