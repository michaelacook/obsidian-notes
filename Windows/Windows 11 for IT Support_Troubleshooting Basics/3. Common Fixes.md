## Booting into Safe Mode

- **Why Use Safe Mode?**
    - Safe Mode loads Windows with a minimal set of Microsoft-provided drivers.
    - Helps bypass faulty third-party drivers or incorrect video settings that may prevent Windows from booting.
    - Allows troubleshooting and fixing issues preventing normal startup.
    
- **Steps to Boot into Safe Mode**
    1. Click **Start** → **Settings**.
    2. Ensure **System** is selected.
    3. Scroll down and click **Recovery**.
    4. Under **Advanced startup**, click **Restart now**.
    5. Save any open work, then confirm **Restart now**.
    6. When the system reboots, it will display the **Choose an option** screen.
    7. Click **Troubleshoot** → **Advanced options** → **Startup Settings**.
    8. Click **Restart** on the Startup Settings screen.
    9. Once the system restarts, select **Option 4** (Enable Safe Mode) using your keyboard.
    
- **Safe Mode Variants**
    - **Option 4** – Standard Safe Mode (No networking or command prompt).
    - **Option 5** – Safe Mode with Networking (Loads network drivers if internet access is needed).
    - **Option 6** – Safe Mode with Command Prompt (For running command-line tools).

- **What to Expect in Safe Mode**
    - Lower video resolution due to reduced drivers.
    - A plain black desktop background.
    - "Safe Mode" text in all four corners of the screen.
    - Limited functionality but sufficient for troubleshooting.
    
- **Exiting Safe Mode**
    - Click **Start** → **Power icon** → **Restart**.
    - Windows will reboot normally, restoring default settings and drivers.

This method allows users to diagnose and fix startup issues by eliminating problematic drivers or configurations.
