    - Click **Startup Repair** to begin automatic diagnosis.

#### Running Startup Repair

3. Windows asks to **choose a target operating system** (appears if multiple OS installations exist).
4. Select **Windows 11** to start the repair process.
5. Windows will **scan for boot issues** and attempt to fix them automatically.

        - Allows trying other tools like **Command Prompt** for manual fixes.
- If unsure, running **Startup Repair** again is usually the best choice.

#### Key Takeaways

- Windows 11 boot issues can often be resolved using **Startup Repair**.
- Booting from **installation media** is required to access repair tools.
- If Startup Repair fails, **Advanced Options** provide additional troubleshooting tools.

 # Startup Items
- `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder`
-  One common reason is startup items loading automatically when the system boots.
- These items often run in the background without user awareness.

#### Legitimate vs. Malicious Startup Items

- Some legitimate applications load at startup for functionality (e.g., update checkers).
- Malware can also load at startup, causing system issues.
- Checking startup items can help diagnose performance problems.

Accessing the Task Manager to Check Startup Items

- Right-click on the Start button and select **Run**.
- Type `taskmgr` and press **OK** to open the **Task Manager**.
- Task Manager displays all running processes and their resource consumption.
- Click on the **Startup** tab to view configured startup programs.

Determining Legitimacy of a Startup Item

- If unsure about an item, there are two methods to verify:
    - **Open File Location**
        - Select the startup item and click on the **More** icon.
        - Choose **Open File Location**, which opens File Explorer.
        - Check the file path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat DC\Acrobat`).
        - A recognizable path usually indicates legitimacy.
    - **Search Online**
        - If the file path is unclear, select the startup item and click **Search Online**.
        - A Bing search will provide information about the executable.
        - If results indicate malware, further investigation is necessary.

Disabling a Startup Item

- Select the startup item in **Task Manager**.
- Click **Disable** to prevent it from loading at startup.
- The status changes from **Enabled** to **Disabled**.

Removing a Startup Item Completely
- Disabling does not remove the item; removing it requires further action.
- Many startup items are deeply embedded in the **Windows Registry**.
- Some programs store startup shortcuts in the **Startup Folder**:
    - Open **Start Menu** and click **All Apps**.
    - Right-click any app and select **More > Open File Location**.
    - Check the folder path (`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`).
    - Navigate to the **Startup** folder.
    - If the program is listed, right-click its shortcut and select **Delete**.
    - This does not remove the application, only prevents auto-start.

Verifying Removal of a Startup Item
- Open **Task Manager** (`taskmgr` via Run command).
- Click the **Startup** tab to confirm the item is no longer listed.
- Some startup items are registry-based and won't appear in the Startup folder.
- Always check both **Task Manager** and **Startup Folder** for thorough cleanup.

Key Takeaways
- Regularly check startup items to improve performance and stability.
- Use **Task Manager** to identify and disable unwanted startup programs.
- Verify file paths or search online if uncertain about a program’s legitimacy.
- Remove items from the **Startup Folder** if applicable.
- Some startup items may require advanced removal via the **Registry Editor**.
