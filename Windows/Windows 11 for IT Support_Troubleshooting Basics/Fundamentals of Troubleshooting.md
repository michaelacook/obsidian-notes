### Three Questions of Troubleshooting

1. **What's changed?**
   - Every issue on a PC stems from a change.
   - Potential changes include:
     - Windows updates
     - Software updates
     - Change in user or usage
     - Physical relocation of the PC
   - Identifying the change can help narrow down the cause of the issue.

2. **When did the problem start?**
   - Knowing the timeframe helps in diagnosing the issue.
   - The problem could relate to a recent update or change.
   - Keep in mind that the issue may affect some users but not others, depending on their usage and software.

3. **Is the problem affecting others?**
   - Check if other people are experiencing the same issue.
   - The problem may be widespread, affecting multiple PCs in the same location or across different sites or countries.
   - This helps to identify whether the issue is specific to one PC or a larger problem.

### Important Considerations

- **Never make assumptions.**
  - Users may have different levels of technical knowledge and may not express issues clearly.
  - Understand that users may use different jargon, may not speak the same language, or may not communicate well about technical problems.
- **Effective questioning:**
  - Ask questions that can be answered with **yes** or **no** to get more accurate and clear information.
  - Avoid asking for complex explanations from users to improve the troubleshooting process.
